Installation
------------
It is possible to install Git and Hg automatically

    perl install.pl [--install-git] [--install-hg]

Manual installation
-------------------
To install Git we need to add EPEL repository

    rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm

And then install git

    yum --disableexcludes=all install git -y

cPanel keeps own copy of Perl. The default install adds exclude rule for "perl*"
in /etc/yum.conf so we are going to bypass this with --disableexcludes=all

For Hg installation execute

    yum install mercurial -y

Same things are done by install.pl script.
